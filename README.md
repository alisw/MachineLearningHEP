Machine learning package for high-energy physics
==================
![Rough.js arc](LHCparticle.jpg)

## Overview of the package:
This software provides a flexible, modular and easy-to-use package to perform classification using Scikit, XGBoost and Keras algorithms. The first purpose of the package is to provide tools for high-energy physicists to perform optimisation of rare signals produced in ultra-relativistic proton-proton and heavy-ion collisions. 

## The package (v0) provides tools to:
- convert ROOT datasets into Pandas Dataframes
- create training and testing dataset starting from samples of data and Monte-Carlo simulations
- perform Principal-Component-Analysis
- training and testing using Scikit, XGBoost and Keras algorithms
- large set of validation tools with a user friendly interface
- conversion of Pandas Dataframe to ROOT objects including algorithm decisions and probabilities 

## Instructions and tutorials
Instructions for installing and running the package are provided in the Wiki section of this repository [wiki](https://github.com/ginnocen/MachineLearningHEP/wiki).

# plot_final_results_*.py OUTDATED

Since this analysis ended up being combined with a non-MLHEP D0 and Lc -> pKpi analysis, the final macros were developed + maintained in the Analysis Note repository. The macros can be found [here](https://gitlab.cern.ch/D_meson_analyses/d2h-vs-mult-pp13/-/tree/master/macros_final) (calculation of the observables, systematic propagation, Lc averaging, ...), and [here](https://gitlab.cern.ch/D_meson_analyses/d2h-vs-mult-pp13/-/tree/master/HP20Preliminaries) (plotting in ALICE Preliminary layout). 

**The functions used are the same as in MachineLearningHEP/machine_learning_hep/utilities_plot.py**
